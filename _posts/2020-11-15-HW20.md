title: HW 20 - Team Progress II
---

Progress on the project is going great! Up to this point we have a fully automated testing system for Tanguru. After running the simple start command, the drivers that we have created automatically run through the 25 test cases that we prewrote. After running the test, the results are printed to an HTML File in Firefox. 


We have worked very well as a team. Each week we meet and divide up tasks for eachother to complete. So far it has been a very smooth progression once we learned how to properly test the software. The-Boyoz are a great team to work with.
