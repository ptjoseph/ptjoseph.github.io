Hi my name is Paul Joseph. I am a senior at the College of Charleston, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Biology. I grew up in Camden, South Carolina. A small town outside of Columbia. When I moved to Charleston I started surfing and kiteboarding and I have caught the so called "fever". I hope to stay in Charleston after graduating to be able to countinue doing what I love.
