Q: Explain why program inspections are an effective technique for discovering errors in a program. What types of errors are unlikely to be discovered during inspections?

A: When an inspection is preformed it is usually done by someone who has never seen the project before. Often it is benefietal to have an outside view of the code. Inspectors check system requirements, source code, sign models, and system tests. The main advantage to inspections are the ability to check quality attributes and incomplete versions of the system can be inspected at no additional cost. Some errors that are unlikely to be discovered during the inspection would be package and dependency installations, compilation problems, and integration problems with other code.
