Ex. 20.10

Q: You work for a software company that has developed a system that provides information about consumers and that is used within a SoS 
by a number of other retail businesses. They pay you for services used. Discuss the ethics of changing the system interfaces without notice
to coerce users into paying higher charges. Consider this question from the point of view of the company's employees, customers, and 
shareholders.


A: I believe this is extremely unethical. For the people working in the company, they are in a tough position because 
if they speak out they could loss their job.Meanwhile, from the view point of the customers, this could give the company a very bad 
reputation if they are caught hiding information from the customer. From the view point of the shareholder, they wouldnâ€™t really mind 
as long as they are making a profit. At some point the unethical higher charges will be revealed which is when the employees will have
this poor software engineering ethical problem the will tarnish their professional record, the customer will feel upset and betrayed, and 
the stakeholders will claim that they were unaware of the situation and avoid blame at all cost.
