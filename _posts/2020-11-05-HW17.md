title: HW17 - Team Progress 1
---

Our team is making great progress so far! For Deliverable 3 we are supposed to make 5 test cases to run out of the 25 that are required for the final. However, we already have all 25 test cases written and running using 5 different drivers.

Team work has been great. We have been meeting once a week to knocked the required assignments to keep on track. We decided to get ahead this week and already have a program that can automatically run 25 different test cases. The boyoz have been a pleasure to work with so far!
