Q:  Briefly describe the 3 main types of software maintenance. Why is it sometimes difficult to distinguish between them?

A:

1. Fault repairs to fix bugs and vulnerabilities- coding errors (cheap fix) , design errors (more expensive fix), and requirement errors (most expensive scenario, intricate system redesign)

2. Environmental adaptation to adapt the software to new platforms and environments, this is required when some aspect of a system's environment changes. Application systems may have been modified to cope with these environmental changes.

3. Functionality addition to add new features and to support new requirements- necessary when system requirements change in response to organizational or business change; the scale of the changes required to the software is often much greater than for the other types of maintenance

Ex 9.10

Q: Do software engineers have a professional responsibility to develop code that can be easily maintained even if their employer does not explicitly request it?

A: 

I believe it is the professional responsibility of a software engineer to develop maintainable code because this is the vital component to making successful software. One should design and implement a system that is secure and easily maintained.
