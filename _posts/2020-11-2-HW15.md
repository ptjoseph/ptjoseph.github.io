Q: Why is it impossible to infer the emergent properties of a complex system from the properties of the system components?

A: Emergent properties are characteristics of the whole system- These properties include performance, reliability, usability, safety, and security. 
Components can have these characteristics as well when utilized on their own, but not when it is part of a whole system.
Also, when humans are in the mix, a new degree of unpredictability is added.
