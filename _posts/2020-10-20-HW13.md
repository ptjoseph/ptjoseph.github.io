Ex 17.10
Q: Your company wishes to move from using desktop applications to accessing same functionality remotely as a service. Identify 3 risks that may arise and how to reduce them.

A: 
Risk 1: 
Database Extensions- if the databases are stored in the desktop applications, one might have migrations problems to a cloud based database

Reduction Recommendation: Do ample research in the database currently being used and create a plan for the best way to move this specific type of database to the cloud- research potential road bumps

Risk 2: 
UX/ UI- when migrating the system the design may look a bit different with may confuse the typical user or create a learning curve for manipulating the new software systems

Reduction Recommendation: warn staff and create a help section for navigation paths that may be different

Risk 3: 
Lack of Allocating Sufficient Migration Time- there might be many more problems that are discovered through the migration process that management may be unimpressed with

Reduction Recommendation: Set migration expectations longer then potentially needed if unsure about this exact process
