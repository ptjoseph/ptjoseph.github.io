Ex 15.10

Q: The reuse of software raises a number of copyright and intellectual property issues. 
If a customer pays a software contractor to develop a system, who has the right to reuse the developed code? 
Does the software contractor have the right to use the code as a basis for a generic component? 
What payment mechanisms might be used to reimburse providers of reusable components? Discuss these issues and other ethical issues associated with the reuse of software.


A: I believe that since the customer paid for the software, he/she should have full rights to the code. The developer can use the generic code from a project that they worked on but if they were to use non-generic code that is specific to the customers software then they should give a certain percentage of profit to the original customer.
